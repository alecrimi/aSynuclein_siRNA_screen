In this project, we are quantifying the degree of a-synuclein cell to cell transfer and if/how it is modulated by each gene within the genome. To this end, we are using a construct encoding GFP-2a-aSynuclein-RFP and we are quantifying the number of recipient cells (RFP+GFP-) normalized to the total number of transfected cells (RFP+GFP+).  

This repository comprises the scripts for the image analysis and graph generations.
The used images are available on http://figshare.com/...

The image analysis scripts are for the Matlab environment, while the picklist scripts are Python scripts.

the script run_all_RG.m calls iterates through the entire dataset computing features and plotting results,

the script red_vs_green.m is the function actually computing the features,

while plot_data.m is the function plotting and saving the heatmaps.

picklist.py and code_python_sRNA_screen.py are the files which map source and destination according to plate picklists reported in final_picklist.zip
