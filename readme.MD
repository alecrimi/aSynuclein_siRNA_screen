In this project, we are quantifying the degree of a-synuclein cell to cell transfer and if/how it is modulated by each gene within the genome. To this end, we are using a construct encoding GFP-2a-aSynuclein-RFP and we are quantifying the number of recipient cells (RFP+GFP-) normalized to the total number of transfected cells (RFP+GFP+).  

This repository comprises the scripts for the image analysis and graph generations.
The used images are available on http://figshare.com/...
